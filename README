All features from the assignment should work as intended.

From the build folder, open human character by running Scotty3D on the human model with:
./scotty3d ../dae/animation/human.dae

A joint skeleton system can be created to control the character by entering animate mode (A), then dragging the root joint from the origin to the center of the character's pelvis.
Press C to enter Create Joint mode, and add a joint for bend  points in the human's mesh (hips, knees, ankles, shoulders, elbows, wrists), as well as for the ends of the appendages (toes, fingertips, head).
To animate, click on a point in the timeline at the bottom of the screen andmove the skeleton either in Pose mode (P), or through IK mode (I) and right clicking after selecting a joint to move.
Hit Space Bar to see your animation!

Open Scotty3D with the grid mesh to see the wave equation in action:
./scotty3d ../dae/grid.dae

Enter Animate mode (A) then Wave mode (W), then select either a Forward Euler (F) or Symplectic Euler (S) simulation. Select a vertex on the mesh and raise it, then hit Space Bar to see the simulation run!
Hold SHIFT -/= before running the simulation to remove/add damping.
